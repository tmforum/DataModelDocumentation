# Service spec characteristic Data Model

## Domain

The  schema is part of the  Domain

## Description

This class represents the key features of this service specification. For example, bandwidth is a characteristic of many different types of services; if bandwidth is a relevant characteristic (e.g., from the point-of-view of a Customer obtaining this Service via a Product) then bandwidth would be a ServiceSpecCharacteristic for that particular Service.

## Data model

A JSON Schema corresponding to this data model can be found
[here](https://github.com/tmforum-rand/schemas/blob/candidates/Service/ServiceSpecCharacteristic.schema.json).

The Data model is defined as shown below:
- `name` : A word, term, or phrase by which this characteristic specification is known and distinguished from other characteristic specifications.
  - Optional
- `description` : A narrative that explains in detail what the serviceSpecCharacteristic is
  - Optional
- `valueType` : A kind of value that the characteristic can take on, such as numeric, text and so forth
  - Optional
- `configurable` : If true, the Boolean indicates that the serviceSpecCharacteristic is configurable
  - Optional
- `validFor` : The period for which the serviceSpecCharacteristic is valid
  - Optional
- `@valueSchemaLocation` : This (optional) field provides a link to the schema describing the value type.
  - Optional
- `minCardinality` : The minimum number of instances a CharacteristicValue can take on. For example, zero to five phone numbers in a group calling plan, where zero is the value for the minCardinality.
  - Optional
- `maxCardinality` : The maximum number of instances a CharacteristicValue can take on. For example, zero to five phone numbers in a group calling plan, where five is the value for the maxCardinality.
  - Optional
- `isUnique` : An indicator that specifies if a value is unique for the specification. Possible values are; &quot;unique while value is in effect&quot; and &quot;unique whether value is in effect or not&quot;
  - Optional
- `regex` : A rule or principle represented in regular expression used to derive the value of a characteristic value.
  - Optional
- `extensible` : An indicator that specifies that the values for the characteristic can be extended by adding new values when instantiating a characteristic for an Entity.
  - Optional
- `serviceSpecCharacteristicValue` : A list of service spec characteristic values (ServiceSpecCharacteristicValue [*]). A ServiceSpecCharacteristicValue object is used to define a set of attributes, each of which can be assigned to a corresponding set of attributes in a ServiceSpecCharacteristic object. The values of the attributes in the ServiceSpecCharacteristicValue object describe the values of the attributes that a corresponding ServiceSpecCharacteristic object can take on.
  - Optional
- `serviceSpecCharRelationship` : A list of service spec char relationships (ServiceSpecCharRelationship [*]). An aggregation, migration, substitution, dependency or exclusivity relationship between/among Specification Characteristics.
  - Optional
